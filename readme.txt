## working in progress ## 
everything should be here in the folders, its pretty simple
-css file is in static
-index is in template !it can be sensative, the html file interacts with the flask server
-post are stored in jason and images in static/upload

other than that its really simple, if use the link to open in your browser to interact with the server
